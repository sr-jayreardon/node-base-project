## How to use this repo
To use this repository as a base for your own projects, simply clone this repo and then remove .git folder from the
project root.

# Actions
NPM actions are included to facilitate most project needs

## Build -- `npm run build`
The build process utilizes Gulp and the included `gulpfile.js`. The `default` gulp taks runs linting and testing only.
However, this gulpfile comes preloaded with a number of other helpful tasks that include linting, testing, and code
reformatting. Changes and additional tasks can be added based on the requirements and needs of the project's build,
packaging and deployment goals.

## Lint -- `npm run lint`
The linting process utilizes ESLint and is preloaded with over 150 rules to validating and quality checking of code.
The [ESLint Rules](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/) can be altered by editing the `.eslintrc.json` file.

## Testing -- `npm test`
The testing process utilizes Mocha and Unit.JS, and includes a base unit test file located in the `test/` folder.
Additional test files and test can be added to the included `test/index.js` file or within the `test/` folder itself.
Further, the tests are piped through Istanbul by using NYC to provide test coverage reporting

## Coverage Report -- `npm run coverage`
Test coverage reporting is facilitated using Instanbul through NYC and then pushing the reporting to Codacy. The
reporting integrates with Codacy and requires extra steps outlined below.

## Fix Code Styling -- `npm run fix`
Some automatic code styling fixes are possible with the preloaded ESLint rules. This command runs ESLint in fix mode to
correct styling issues.

## Prettify Code Styling -- `npm run pretty`
Automatic code prettification for standardized code styling is performed by Prettier, the outputted prettified code is
then sent through ESLint in fix mode to correct some minor styling issues that Prettier introduces. The
[prettier options](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html) can be configured in the `.prettierrc.json` file, and if
no piping through ESLint is desired, then the `pretty` action in the `gulpfile.js` can be modified. However, if this is
desired then all formatting rules in `.eslintrc.json` should be removed.

## Generate JSDocs -- `npm run docs`
Automatic generation of JSDocs using `index.js` as the base file, and placing documentation into the `docs/` folder.

# Configuration / Information

## TravisCI Integration
It is highly recommended that you install the [TravisCI CLI](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis.rb) tool before
beginning. The `.travis.yml` file is included for use with TravisCI.

## Codacy Coverage

In order for Codacy Coverage to work this to work, the Codacy Project Token must be added to your environment variables.

This can be done by setting the appropriate environment variable:
```
export CODACY_PROJECT_TOKEN=<Token_from_Codacy>
```
Or, by updating the `package.json` file to update the coverage action as follows

```js
  "coverage": "cross-env CODACY_PROJECT_TOKEN=<Token_from_Codacy> nyc --reporter=lcov mocha && cat ./coverage/lcov.info | codacy-coverage"
```

When integrating with Travis you will also need to configure travis with the environment variable for building by
performing:
```
travis encrypt CODACY_PROJECT_TOKEN=<Token_from_Codacy> --add
```

### Local Coverage

The coverage update can also be run locally by updating the `package.json` file by editing the
`config.codacyProjectToken` value to the current token; and then performing:

```
npm run local-coverage
```

## Node Version and Standards
Ensuring that a standardized version of NodeJS is being used across projects is important for consistency of
environment. More information on configuring the Node environment can be found in the [NodeJS Standards](https://github.com/DealersLinkDevTeam/node-base-project/wiki/NodeJS-Standards) documentation.

## Code Standards / ES6 Linting / Code Cleanup

These projects use two tools, `eslint` and `prettier` to assist in conforming code to proper standards. The
files `.eslinkrc.json` and `.prettierrc.json` come pre-configured to assist with ensuring code standards. The `prettier`
rule set is a more restrictive subset of the `eslint` ruleset; therefore, any code formatted by `prettier` will always
pass the linting done by `eslint`.  

Code is not automatically formatted with git hooks using either the `eslint --fix` or `prettier`, instead these commands
are left to the option of the developer to use as they are necessary, since it may be desirable to fix certain code
linting/standards issues by hand.

Please see the Wiki for more information regarding [Code Standards](https://github.com/DealersLinkDevTeam/node-base-project/wiki/Code-Standards).
