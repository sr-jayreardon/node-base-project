# ESLint Rules
The ESLint configuration uses a modified version of the [`eslint:recommended`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/)
ruleset. Where it is relevant, the rule will be highlighted as such. These rules can be found in the `.eslintrc.json`
file found in the root-level folder of the project.

Each rule will be presented with an example of the bad code that it is designed to prevent and rationale as to
why the pattern should be avoided.

Code that triggers rules with the 🛠 symbol can be automatically fixed using the `fix` option on ESLint, by running the
`gulp fix` task or running the `npm run fix` script.

## Syntax and Logic Errors
These rules relate to possible syntax errors or logical errors within the code.


### no-compare-neg-zero (error) [recommended]
Disallow comparing against -0

#### Rationale
`-0` is a distinct value in floating-point numbers from `+0`, comparisons against other floating-point numbers can
lead to unexpected behavior when comparing against `-0`. That is, code like `x === -0` will pass for both `+0` and `-0`.
**Note**: Normal ECMAScript comparison operations treat `+0` and `-0` identically, and floating points operations
generally do not create `-0` results. However, the ECMAScript `Math` library can.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
if (x === -0) {
  // Do something...
}
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
if (x === 0) {
  // Do something...
}
```

```js
// Compare for floating-point neg-zero
if (Object.is(x, -0)) {
  // Do something...
}
```


### no-cond-assign (error) [recommended]
Disallow assignment operators in conditional expressions in `if`, `for`, `while`, and `do...while` statements.

#### Rationale
In conditional statements, it is very easy to mistype a comparison operator (such as `==`) as an assignment operator
(such as `=`). There are valid reasons to use assignment operators in conditional statements; however, it can be
difficult to tell whether a specific assignment was intentional, leading to code which is more difficult to maintain.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
// Check the user's job title
if (user.jobTitle = 'manager') {
  // user.jobTitle is now incorrect
}
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
// Check the user's job title
if (user.jobTitle === 'manager') {
  // do something...
}
```


### no-console (warn)
Disallow the use of `console`

#### Rationale
In JavaScript that is designed to be used in browsers or as middleware layers, it is considered a best practice to
avoid using methods on `console`. Such messages are considered to be for debugging purposes and therefore are not
suitable to ship to the client. In general, calls using `console` should be stripped or converted to logging
operations before being pushed to production. This rule is configured as a ***warning*** because command line tools will
require the use of `console` and in mixed development environments this is unavoidable in a codebase.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
console.log('Info');
console.warn('Warning');
console.error('Error');
```


### no-constant-condition (error) [recommended]
Disallow constant expression in conditions in `if`, `for`, `while`, `do...while`, and ternary (e.g `?:`) statements

#### Rationale
Constant expressions as test conditions may be typos or a development trigger for a specific behavior. It is
difficult to determine the intention of the code author and the code can be simplified. Additionally, such code is
not ready for production and should generally be avoided.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
if (false) {
  doSomethingUnfinished();
}

if (void x) {
  doSomethingUnfinished();
}

for (;-2;) {
  doSomethingForever();
}

while (typeof x) {
  doSomethingForever();
}

do {
  doSomethingForever();
} while (x = -1);

var result = 0 ? a : b;
```


### no-control-regex (warn)
Disallow control characters in regular expressions.

#### Rationale
Control characters are special, invisible characters in the ASCII range 0-31. These characters are rarely used in
JavaScript strings, so a regular expression containing these characters is most likely a mistake and generally lead to
difficult to read code. This is a warning, because there are times when this type of regular expression is still
necessary.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
let pattern1 = /\x1f/;
let pattern2 = new RegExp('\x1f');
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
let pattern1 = /\x20/;
let pattern2 = new RegExp('\x20');
```


### no-debugger (error) [recommended] 🛠
Disallow the use of debugger.

#### Rationale
The `debugger` statement is used to tell the executing JavaScript environment to stop execution and open the debugger at
the current point in the code. This is considered bad practice as it leads to code which is not production ready and
modern development and debugging tools are now available which renders such behaviors obsolete.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
function isTruthy(x) {
  debugger;
  return Boolean(x);
}
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
function isTruthy(x) {
  return Boolean(x); // set a breakpoint at this line
}
```


### no-dupe-args (error) [recommended]
Disallow duplicate arguments in function definitions. It does not apply to arrow functions or class methods, because the
JavaScript parser reports these as errors.

#### Rationale
If more than one parameter has the same name in a function definition, the last occurrence “shadows” the preceding
occurrences. A duplicated name might be a typing error. This can result in unexpected behaviors and code that is
difficult to maintain.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
function foo(a, b, a) {
  console.log('value of the second a:', a);
}

var bar = function (a, b, a) {
  console.log('value of the second a:', a);
};
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
function foo(a, b, c) {
  console.log(a, b, c);
}

let bar = function (a, b, c) {
  console.log(a, b, c);
};
```


### no-dupe-keys (error) [recommended]
Disallow duplicate keys in object literals.

#### Rationale
Multiple properties with the same key in object literals can cause unexpected behavior and code that is difficult to
maintain.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
let foo = {
  bar: 'baz',
  bar: 'qux'
};

let foo = {
  'bar': 'baz',
  bar: 'qux'
};

let foo = {
  0x1: 'baz',
  1: 'qux'
};
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
let foo = {
  bar: 'baz',
  quxx: 'qux'
};
```


### no-duplicate-case (error) [recommended]
Disallow duplicate case labels.

#### Rationale
If a `switch` statement has duplicate test expressions in `case` clauses, then it is likely that a programmer copied a
`case` clause but forgot to change the test expression. Additionally, the duplicated case will never be reached,
leading to possible unexpected behavior.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
var a = 1,
  one = 1;

switch (a) {
  case 1:
    break;
  case 2:
    break;
  case 1:         // duplicate test expression
    break;
  default:
    break;
}
```


### no-empty (error)
Disallow empty block statements. This rule ignores block statements which contain a comment such as `catch` or `finally`
blocks within a `try` statement. This rule is configured to ignore empty `catch` blocks.

#### Rationale
Empty block statements, while not technically errors, usually occur due to refactoring that wasn’t completed. They can
cause confusion when reading code.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
if (foo) {
}

while (foo) {
}

switch(foo) {
}

try {
  doSomething();
} catch(ex) {
  // Ignored
} finally {
}
```


### no-empty-character-class (error) [recommended]
Disallow empty character classes in regular expressions

#### Rationale
Because empty character classes in regular expressions do not match anything, they usually indicate typing mistakes.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
let foo = /^abc[]/;
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
let foo = /^abc[d-z]/;
let bar = /^[abc]/;
let baz = /^abc/;
```


### no-ex-assign (error) [recommended]
Disallow reassigning exceptions in `catch` clauses.

#### Rationale
If a `catch` clause in a `try` statement accidentally (or purposely) assigns another value to the exception parameter,
it becomes impossible to refer to the error from that point on. Since there is no arguments object to offer alternative
access to this data, such an assignment of the parameter is absolutely destructive.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
try {
    // code
} catch (e) {
  e = 10;
}
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
try {
  // code
} catch (e) {
  let foo = 10;
}
```


### no-extra-boolean-cast (error) [recommended] 🛠
Disallow unnecessary boolean casts.

#### Rationale
In contexts such as an `if` statement’s test where the result of the expression will already be coerced to a Boolean,
casting to a Boolean via double negation (`!!`) or a `Boolean` call is unnecessary and confusing.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
if (!!foo) {
  // ...
}

if (Boolean(foo)) {
  // ...
}
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
if (foo) {
  // ...
}
```


### no-extra-semi (error) [recommended] 🛠
Disallow unnecessary semicolons

#### Rationale
Typing mistakes and misunderstandings about where semicolons are required can lead to semicolons that are unnecessary.
While not technically an error, extra semicolons can cause confusion when reading code.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
let x = 5;;

function foo() {
  // code
};
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
let x = 5;

function foo() {
  // code
}
```


### no-func-assign (error) [recommended]
Disallow reassigning function declarations.

#### Rationale
JavaScript functions can be written as a Function Declaration `function foo() { ... }` or as a FunctionExpression
`let foo = function() { ... };`. While a JavaScript interpreter might tolerate it, overwriting/reassigning a function
written as a Function Declaration is often indicative of a mistake or issue, and is confusing to read.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
function foo() {}
foo = bar;

function foo() {
  foo = bar;
}
```


### no-inner-declarations (error) [recommended]
Disallow variable or function declarations in nested blocks.

#### Rationale
In JavaScript, prior to ES6, a function declaration is only allowed in the first level of a program or the body of
another function, though parsers sometimes erroneously accept them elsewhere. This only applies to function
declarations; named or anonymous function expressions can occur anywhere an expression is permitted.

A variable declaration (`var`) is permitted anywhere a statement can go, even nested deeply inside other blocks. This is
often undesirable due to variable hoisting, and moving declarations to the root of the program or function body can
increase clarity. Note that block bindings (`let`, `const`) are not hoisted and therefore they are not affected by this
rule.

#### 👍👎 Pre-ES6 Example code
```js
// Good
function doSomething() { }

// Bad
if (test) {
  function doSomethingElse () { }
}

function anotherThing() {
  var fn;

  if (test) {
    // Good
    fn = function expression() { };

    // Bad
    function declaration() { }
  }
}
```

#### 👍👎 Variable Hoisting Example code
```js
// Good
var foo = 42;

// Good
if (foo) {
  let bar1;
}

// Bad
while (test) {
  var bar2;
}

function doSomething() {
  // Good
  var baz = true;

  // Bad
  if (baz) {
    var quux;
  }
}
```


### no-invalid-regexp (error) [recommended]
Disallow invalid regular expression strings in RegExp constructors.

#### Rationale
An invalid pattern in a regular expression literal is a `SyntaxError` when the code is parsed, but an invalid string in
`RegExp` constructors throws a `SyntaxError` only when the code is executed. This rule ensures that no invalid code
will be executed.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
RegExp('[')

RegExp('.', 'z')

new RegExp('\\')
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
RegExp('.')

new RegExp
```


### no-irregular-whitespace (error) [recommended]
Disallow irregular whitespace outside of strings and comments. This rule disallows the following characters:
```
\u000B - Line Tabulation (\v) - <VT>
\u000C - Form Feed (\f) - <FF>
\u00A0 - No-Break Space - <NBSP>
\u0085 - Next Line
\u1680 - Ogham Space Mark
\u180E - Mongolian Vowel Separator - <MVS>
\ufeff - Zero Width No-Break Space - <BOM>
\u2000 - En Quad
\u2001 - Em Quad
\u2002 - En Space - <ENSP>
\u2003 - Em Space - <EMSP>
\u2004 - Tree-Per-Em
\u2005 - Four-Per-Em
\u2006 - Six-Per-Em
\u2007 - Figure Space
\u2008 - Punctuation Space - <PUNCSP>
\u2009 - Thin Space
\u200A - Hair Space
\u200B - Zero Width Space - <ZWSP>
\u2028 - Line Separator
\u2029 - Paragraph Separator
\u202F - Narrow No-Break Space
\u205f - Medium Mathematical Space
\u3000 - Ideographic Space
```

#### Rationale
Invalid or irregular whitespace causes issues with ECMAScript 5 parsers and also makes code harder to debug in a similar
nature to mixed tabs and spaces.

Various whitespace characters can be inputted by programmers by mistake for example from copying or keyboard shortcuts.
Pressing Alt + Space on OS X adds in a non breaking space character for example.

Known issues these spaces cause:

  * Zero Width Space
      * Is NOT considered a separator for tokens and is often parsed as an Unexpected token ILLEGAL
      * Is NOT shown in modern browsers making code repository software expected to resolve the visualisation
  * Line Separator
      * Is NOT a valid character within JSON which would cause parse errors


### no-obj-calls (error) [recommended]
Disallow calling global object properties (`Math`, `JSON`, and `Reflect`) as functions.

#### Rationale
ECMAScript provides several global objects that are intended to be used as-is. Some of these objects look as if they
could be constructors due their capitalization (such as `Math`, `JSON`, and `Reflect`) but will throw an error if you
try to execute them as functions.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
var math = Math();
var json = JSON();
var reflect = Reflect();
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
function area(r) {
  return Math.PI * r * r;
}
var object = JSON.parse('{}');
var value = Reflect.get({ x: 1, y: 2 }, 'x');
```


### no-regex-spaces (error) [recommended] 🛠
Disallow multiple spaces in regular expressions

#### Rationale
Regular expressions can be very complex and difficult to understand, which is why it’s important to keep them as simple
as possible in order to avoid mistakes. One of the more error-prone things you can do with a regular expression is to
use more than one space.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
var re = /foo       bar/; // How many spaces are intended to be matched here?
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
var re = /foo {7}bar/;    // Clear indication on the number of spaces to match
```


### no-sparse-arrays (error) [recommended]
Disallow sparse arrays

#### Rationale
A sparse array contains empty slots, most frequently due to multiple commas being used in an array literal. For Example:
```
var items = [,,];
```
While the `items` array in this example has a `length` of 2, there are actually no values indices 0 and 1. The fact that
the array literal is valid with only commas inside, coupled with the length being set and actual item values not being
set, make sparse arrays confusing for many developers and prone to logic errors. Additionally, these are often an
indication that there is an unintended syntax error in the code.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
var colors = [ 'red',, 'blue' ];    // Did the developer intend for this array to have length 3, or is it a typo?
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
var colors = [ 'red', 'blue' ];
```


### no-unreachable (error) [recommended]
Disallow unreachable code after `return`, `throw`, `continue`, and `break` statements

#### Rationale
Because the `return`, `throw`, `break`, and `continue` statements unconditionally exit a block of code, any statements
after them cannot be executed. Unreachable statements are usually a mistake.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
function fn() {
  x = 1;
  return x;
  x = 3;      // this will never execute
}
```


### no-unsafe-finally (error) [recommended]
Disallow control flow statements in `finally` blocks

#### Rationale
JavaScript suspends the control flow statements of `try` and `catch` blocks until the execution of `finally` block
finishes. So, when `return`, `throw`, `break`, or `continue` are used in `finally`, control flow statements inside `try`
and `catch` are overwritten, which is considered as unexpected behavior.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
let foo = function() {
  try {
    return 1;
  } catch(err) {
    return 2;
  } finally {
    return 3;
  }
};

let bar = function() {
  try {
    return 1;
  } catch(err) {
    return 2;
  } finally {
    throw new Error;
  }
}
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
let foo = function() {
  try {
    return 1;
  } catch(err) {
    return 2;
  } finally {
    console.log('hola!');
  }
};
```


### no-unsafe-negation (error) [recommended] 🛠
Disallow negating the left operand of relational operators

#### Rationale
Just as developers might type `-a + b` when they mean `-(a + b)` for the negative of a sum, they might type
`!key in object` by mistake when they almost certainly mean `!(key in object)` to test that a key is not in an object.
`!obj instanceof Ctor` is similar. Such code can be confusing to read and may lead to unintended logic.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
if (!key in object) {
  // operator precedence makes it equivalent to (!key) in object
  // and type conversion makes it equivalent to (key ? 'false' : 'true') in object
}

if (!obj instanceof Ctor) {
  // operator precedence makes it equivalent to (!obj) instanceof Ctor
  // and it equivalent to always false since boolean values are not objects.
}
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
if (!(key in object)) {
  // key is not in object
}

if (!(obj instanceof Ctor)) {
  // obj is not an instance of Ctor
}
```


### use-isnan (error) [recommended]
Require calls to isNaN() when checking for NaN

#### Rationale
In JavaScript, `NaN` is a special value of the `Number` type. It’s used to represent any of the “not-a-number” values
represented by the double-precision 64-bit format as specified by the IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic.

Because `NaN` is unique in JavaScript by not being equal to anything, including itself, the results of comparisons to
`NaN` are confusing:

  * `NaN === NaN` or `NaN == NaN` evaluate to false
  * `NaN !== NaN` or `NaN != NaN` evaluate to true

Therefore, use `Number.isNaN()` or global `isNaN()` functions to test whether a value is `NaN` leads to consistent and
readable code.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
if (foo == NaN) {
  // ...
}

if (foo != NaN) {
  // ...
}
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
if (isNaN(foo)) {
  // ...
}

if (!isNaN(foo)) {
  // ...
}
```


### valid-typeof  (error) [recommended]
Enforce comparing `typeof` expressions against valid strings.

#### Rationale
For a vast majority of use cases, the result of the `typeof` operator is one of the following string literals:
`'undefined'`, `'object'`, `'boolean'`, `'number'`, `'string'`, `'function'`, and `'symbol'`. It is usually a typing
mistake to compare the result of a `typeof` operator to other string literals.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
typeof foo === 'strnig'
typeof foo == 'undefimed'
typeof bar != 'nunber'
typeof bar !== 'fucntion'
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
typeof foo === 'string'
typeof bar == 'undefined'
typeof foo === baz
typeof bar === typeof qux
```



## Best Practices
These rules enforce coding Best Practices.


### block-scoped-var (warn)
Treat `var` as Block Scoped and report a warning when it is used in a potentially inconsistent way.

#### Rationale
This rule aims to reduce the usage of variables outside of their binding context and emulate traditional block scope
from other languages. This is to help newcomers to the language avoid difficult bugs with variable hoisting.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
function doIf() {
  if (true) {
    var build = true;   // Hoisted variable 'build' to outside block scope
  }
  console.log(build);   // This works because 'build' was hoisted, although this may not be intended
}

function doIfElse() {
  if (true) {
    var build = true;   // Hoisted variable 'build' to outside block scope
  } else {
    var build = false;  // Hoisted variable 'build' to outside block scope
  }
}

function doTryCatch() {
  try {
    var build = 1;  // Hoisted variable 'build' to outside block scope
  } catch (e) {
    var f = build;  // Hoisted variable 'f' to outside block scope
  }
}
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
// This code is functionally identical but clearer in its intentions
function doIf() {
  var build;

  if (true) {
    build = true;
  }

  console.log(build);
}

function doIfElse() {
  var build;

  if (true) {
    build = true;
  } else {
    build = false;
  }
}

function doTryCatch() {
  var build;
  var f;

  try {
    build = 1;
  } catch (e) {
    f = build;
  }
}
```


### complexity (warn)
Limit Cyclomatic Complexity -- the number of paths through a block of source code. This is set to 15.

#### Rationale
This rule is aimed at reducing code complexity by capping the amount of cyclomatic complexity allowed in a program. As
such, it will warn when the cyclomatic complexity crosses the configured threshold.  High complexity is generally an
indication that a code block should be split into smaller function blocks; however, this is set as a warning with a
threshold of 15, as there are some unavoidable blocks, such as dense `switch` statements, where high complexity is
unavoidable.

#### 👎 Bad code (Complexity set to 2)
```js
/*eslint complexity: ['error', 2]*/

function a(x) {
  if (true) {
    return x;       // 1st Path
  } else if (false) {
    return x+1;     // 2nd Path
  } else {
    return 4;       // 3rd path
  }
}
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
/*eslint complexity: ['error', 2]*/

function a(x) {
  if (true) {
    return x;
  } else {
    return 4;
  }
}
```


### consistent-return (warn)
Require `return` statements to consistently always or never specify values within a function block.

#### Rationale
Unlike statically-typed languages which enforce that a function returns a specified type of value, JavaScript allows
different code paths in a function to return different types of values.

A confusing aspect of JavaScript is that a function returns `undefined` if any of the following are true:

  * it does not execute a `return` statement before it exits
  * it executes `return` which does not specify a value explicitly
  * it executes `return undefined`
  * it executes `return void` followed by an expression (for example, a function call)
  * it executes `return` followed by any other expression which evaluates to `undefined`

If any code paths in a function return a value explicitly but some code path do not return a value explicitly, it might
be a typing mistake, especially in a large function.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
function doSomething(condition) {
  if (condition) {
    return true;    // Value returned
  } else {
    return;         // No value returned
  }
}
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
function doSomething(condition) {
  if (condition) {
    return true;        // Value returned
  } else {
    return undefined;   // Undefined value explicitly provided
  }
}

function doSomethingElse(condition) {
  if (condition) {
    return true;        // Value returned
  } else {
    return false;       // Value returned
  }
}
```


### curly (error) 🛠
Require following Curly Brace Conventions

#### Rationale
JavaScript allows the omission of curly braces when a block contains only one statement. However, it is considered by
many to be best practice to never omit curly braces around blocks, even when they are optional, because it can lead to
bugs and reduces code clarity.  All code blocks require curly braces.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
if (foo) foo++;
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
if (foo) {
    foo++;
}
```


### default-case (error)
Require Default Case in Switch Statements

#### Rationale
The thinking is that it’s better to always explicitly state what the `default` behavior should be, even when it is no
behavior, so that it’s clear as to whether or not the developer forgot to include the default behavior by mistake.
When the `default` case is empty, a comment is recommended.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
switch (foo) {
  case 1:
    doSomething();
    break;

  case 2:
    doSomething();
    break;

  // No default
}
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
switch (foo) {
  case 1:
    doSomething();
    break;

  case 2:
    doSomething();
    break;

  default:
    // Do nothing
    break;
}
```

### dot-location (error) 🛠
Enforce newline consistency before or after dot when a newline is used.

#### Rationale
JavaScript allows you to place newlines before or after a dot in a member expression. Consistency in placing a newline
before (property-side) or after (object-side) the dot can greatly increase readability.  New lines are not required,
but when they are included this rule is configured to enforce property-side dots.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
var foo = object.
  property;
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
var foo = object
  .property;
```


### dot-notation (error) 🛠
Require Dot Notation

#### Rationale
In JavaScript, one can access properties using the dot notation (`foo.bar`) or square-bracket notation (`foo['bar']`).
However, the dot notation is often preferred because it is easier to read, less verbose, and works better with
aggressive JavaScript minimizers.  This rule is aimed at maintaining code consistency and improving code readability by
encouraging use of the dot notation style whenever possible.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
var x = foo['bar'];
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
var x = foo.bar;
var y = foo[bar];    // Property name is a variable, square-bracket notation required
```


### eqeqeq (error) 🛠
Require `===` and `!==`

#### Rationale
Because of type coercion and its unintended side-effects, it is considered good practice to use the type-safe equality
operators `===` and `!==` instead of their regular counterparts `==` and `!=`.

The reason for this is that `==` and `!=` do type coercion which follows the rather obscure
[Abstract Equality Comparison Algorithm](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-11.9.3). For instance, the
following statements are all considered `true`:

  * `[] == false`
  * `[] == ![]`
  * `3 == '03'`

If one of those occurs in an innocent-looking statement such as `a == b` the actual problem is very difficult to spot.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
if (x == 42) { }

if ('' == text) { }

if (obj.getStuff() != undefined) { }
```


### guard-for-in (warn)
Require Guarding for-in

#### Rationale
Looping over objects with a `for...in` loop will include properties that are inherited through the prototype chain. This
behavior can lead to unexpected items in your for loop. This rule is aimed at preventing unexpected behavior that could
arise from using a `for...in` loop without filtering the results in the loop. As such, it will warn when for in loops do
not filter their results with an if statement.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
for (key in foo) {
  doSomething(key);
}
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
for (key in foo) {
  if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(foo, key)) {
    doSomething(key);
  }
}
```


### no-alert (warn)
Disallow Use of Alert

#### Rationale
JavaScript’s `alert`, `confirm`, and `prompt` functions are widely considered to be obtrusive as UI elements and should
be replaced by a more appropriate custom UI implementation. Furthermore, `alert` is often used while debugging code,
which should be removed before deployment to production.  This rule is aimed at catching debugging code that should be
removed and replaced with less obtrusive, custom UIs.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
alert('here!');
confirm('Are you sure?');
prompt('What\'s your name?', 'John Doe');
```


### no-caller (error)
Disallow Use of `caller` and `callee`.

#### Rationale
The use of `arguments.caller` and `arguments.callee` make several code optimizations impossible and are deprecated.
Further, their use is forbidden in ES5 `strict` mode.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
function foo(n) {
  if (n <= 0) {
    return;
  }

  arguments.callee(n - 1);
}

[1,2,3,4,5].map(function(n) {
  return !(n > 1) ? 1 : arguments.callee(n - 1) * n;
});
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
function foo(n) {
  if (n <= 0) {
    return;
  }

  foo(n - 1);
}

[1,2,3,4,5].map(function factorial(n) {
  return !(n > 1) ? 1 : factorial(n - 1) * n;
});
```


### no-case-declarations (error) [recommended]
Disallow lexical declarations in case/default clauses

#### Rationale
This rule disallows lexical declarations (`let`, `const`, `function` and `class`) in `case`/`default` clauses. The
reason is that the lexical declaration are visible in the entire `switch` block but are only initialized when they are
assigned, which will only happen if the case where it is defined is reached. This rule aims to prevent access to
uninitialized lexical bindings as well as accessing hoisted functions across case clauses.

To ensure that the lexical declaration only applies to the current case, it is recommended to wrap your clauses in
blocks.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
switch (foo) {
  case 1:
    let x = 1;
    break;
  case 2:
    const y = 2;
    break;
  case 3:
    function f() {}
    break;
  default:
    class C {}
}
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
// Declarations outside switch-statements are valid
const a = 0;

switch (foo) {
  // The following case clauses are wrapped into blocks using brackets
  case 1: {
    let x = 1;
    break;
  }
  case 2: {
    const y = 2;
    break;
  }
  case 3: {
    function f() {}
    break;
  }
  case 4:
    // Declarations using var without brackets are valid due to function-scope hoisting
    var z = 4;
    break;
  default: {
    class C {}
  }
}
```


### no-div-regex (warn)
Disallow Regexs That Look Like Division

#### Rationale
This is used to disambiguate the division operator to not confuse users.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
return /=foo/;
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
return /\=foo/;
```


### no-else-return (warn) 🛠
Disallow return before else

#### Rationale
If an `if` block contains a `return` statement, the `else` block becomes unnecessary. Its contents can be placed outside
of the block. This is aimed at code consistency and brevity.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
function foo() {
  if (x) {
    return y;
  } else {
    // Any Code here is unnecessary
    doSomething();
  }
}
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
function foo() {
  if (x) {
    return y;
  }
  // Else statement removed
  doSomething();
}
```


### no-empty-function (error)
Disallow empty functions

#### Rationale
Empty functions can reduce readability because readers need to guess whether it’s intentional or not. So writing a clear
comment for empty functions is a good practice. This rule will pass empty functions where there is a clear comment
indicating that the empty function is intended. This rule is also configured to ignore constructors and arrow functions.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
function foo() {}

var foo = function() {};
// etc.
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
function foo() {
  // Do nothing...
}

var foo = function() {
  // Do nothing...
};

// Empty Arror Function Okay
var foo = (() => {});

// Empty constructor Okay
class T {
  constructor() {}
}
```


### no-empty-pattern (error) [recommended]
Disallow empty destructuring patterns

#### Rationale
When using destructuring, it’s possible to create a pattern that has no effect. This happens when empty curly braces are
used to the right of an embedded object destructuring pattern. In many cases, an empty object pattern is a mistake where
the author intended to use a default value instead. This rule aims to flag any empty patterns in destructured objects
and arrays.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
var {} = foo;
var [] = foo;
var {a: {}} = foo;
var {a: []} = foo;
function foo({}) {}
function foo([]) {}
function foo({a: {}}) {}
function foo({a: []}) {}
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
var {a = {}} = foo;
var {a = []} = foo;
function foo({a = {}}) {}
function foo({a = []}) {}
```


### no-eval (warn)
Disallow `eval()`

#### Rationale
JavaScript’s eval() function is potentially dangerous and is often misused. Using `eval()` on untrusted code can open a
program up to several different injection attacks. The use of `eval()` in most contexts can be substituted for a better,
alternative approach to a problem. This rule is aimed at preventing potentially dangerous, unnecessary, and slow code by
disallowing the use of the `eval()` function.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
var obj = { x: 'foo' },
  key = 'x',
  value = eval('obj.' + key);

(0, eval)('var a = 0');

var foo = eval;   // Attempting to alias 'eval' to 'foo'
foo('var a = 0');

// This `this` is the global object.
this.eval('var a = 0');
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
var obj = { x: 'foo' },
  key = 'x',
  value = obj[key];

class A {
  foo() {
    // This is a user-defined method.
    this.eval('var a = 0');
  }

  eval() {
    // Does nothing...
  }
}
```


### no-extra-label (error) 🛠
Disallow Unnecessary Labels

#### Rationale
If a loop contains no nested loops or switches, labeling the loop is unnecessary.  You can achieve the same result by
removing the label and using `break` or `continue` without a label. Such labels are confusing because there is an
expectation that the label is used to jump further ahead or behind in the code.  This rule is aimed at the removal of
labels in general.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
A: while (a) {
  break A;
}

B: for (let i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
  break B;
}

C: switch (a) {
  case 0:
    break C;
}
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
while (a) {
  break;
}

for (let i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
  break;
}

switch (a) {
  case 0:
    break;
}
```


### no-fallthrough (error) [recommended]
Disallow Case Statement Fallthrough without additional comments.

#### Rationale
The switch statement in JavaScript is one of the more error-prone constructs of the language thanks in part to the
ability to “fall through” from one case to the next. This rule is aimed at eliminating unintentional fallthrough of one
case to the other. As such, it flags any fallthrough scenarios that are not marked by a comment. Flow control Statements
(`return`, `throw`, `break`) all prevent fallthrough and are not flagged.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
switch(foo) {
  case 1:
    doSomething();    // Notice the lack of `break` statment
  case 2:
    doSomething();
}
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
switch(foo) {
  case 1:
    doSomething();    
    // Intentional Fallthrough
  case 2:
    doSomething();
    break;
}
```


### no-floating-decimal (error) 🛠
Disallow Floating Decimals

#### Rationale
Float values in JavaScript contain a decimal point, and there is no requirement that the decimal point be preceded or
followed by a number. Although not a syntax error, this format for numbers can make it difficult to distinguish between
true decimal numbers and the dot operator. For this reason, it is recommended that you should always include a number
before and after a decimal point to make it clear the intent is to create a decimal number.  

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
var num = .5;
var num = 2.;
var num = -.7;
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
var num = 0.5;
var num = 2.0;
var num = -0.7;
```


### no-global-assign (error) [recommended]
Disallow assignment to native objects or read-only global variables

#### Rationale
JavaScript environments contain a number of built-in global variables, such as `window` in browsers and `process` in
Node.js. In almost all cases, you don’t want to assign a value to these global variables as doing so could result in
losing access to important functionality. This rule disallows modifications to read-only global variables which are
configured based on the ESLint environment (`env`) -- `node`, `es6`, and `mocha`.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
Object = null;
undefined = 1;
```


### no-implied-eval (error)
Disallow Implied `eval()`

#### Rationale
It’s considered a good practice to avoid using `eval()` in JavaScript. There are security and performance implications
involved with doing so, which is why many linters (including ESLint) recommend disallowing `eval()`. However, there are
some other ways to pass a string and have it interpreted as JavaScript code that have similar concerns.

Using `setTimeout()`, `setInterval()`, or `execScript()` (Internet Explorer only), which can accept a string of
JavaScript code as their first argument is considered an implied `eval()` because the string of JavaScript code is
passed to the interpreter.  It is recommended that a function always be passed as the first argument to these.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
setTimeout('alert('Hi!');', 100);

setInterval('alert('Hi!');', 100);

execScript('alert('Hi!')');

window.setTimeout('count = 5', 10);

window.setInterval('foo = bar', 10);
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
setTimeout(function() {
  alert('Hi!');
}, 100);

setInterval(function() {
  alert('Hi!');
}, 100);
```


### no-invalid-this (error)
Disallow this keywords outside of classes or class-like objects.

#### Rationale
Under the strict mode, `this` keywords outside of classes or class-like objects might be `undefined` and raise a
`TypeError`. This rule aims to flag usage of this keywords outside of classes or class-like objects.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
'use strict';

this.a = 0;
baz(() => this);

(function() {
    this.a = 0;
    baz(() => this);
})();
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
'use strict';

function Foo() {
    // OK, this is in a legacy style constructor.
    this.a = 0;
    baz(() => this);
}

class Foo {
    constructor() {
        // OK, this is in a constructor.
        this.a = 0;
        baz(() => this);
    }
}
```


### no-iterator (error)
Disallow Iterator

#### Rationale
The `__iterator__` property was a SpiderMonkey extension to JavaScript that could be used to create custom iterators
that are compatible with JavaScript’s `for...in` and `for...each` constructs. However, this property is now obsolete,
so it should not be used. Instead, [ES6 iterators and generator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Iterators_and_Generators)
should be used.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
Foo.prototype.__iterator__ = function() {
    return new FooIterator(this);
};

foo.__iterator__ = function () {};

foo['__iterator__'] = function () {};
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
// Additional exmaples -- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols
function Foo(array) {
  var nextIndex = 0;

  return {
    next: function() {
      return nextIndex < array.length ?
        {value: array[nextIndex++], done: false} :
        {done: true};
    }
  };
}
```


### no-labels (error)
Disallow Labeled Statements

#### Rationale
Labeled statements in JavaScript are used in conjunction with break and continue to control flow around multiple loops.
While convenient in some cases, labels tend to be used only rarely and are frowned upon by some as a remedial form of
flow control that is more error prone and harder to understand. This rule aims to eliminate the use of labeled
statements in JavaScript. It will warn whenever a labeled statement is encountered and whenever `break` or `continue`
are used with a label.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
label:
  while(true) {
    // ...
  }

label:
  while(true) {
    break label;
  }

label:
  while(true) {
    continue label;
  }

label:
  switch (a) {
    case 0:
      break label;
  }

label:
  {
    break label;
  }

label:
  if (a) {
    break label;
  }
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
var f = {
  label: 'foo'
};

while (true) {
  break;
}

while (true) {
  continue;
}
```


### no-lone-blocks (error)
Disallow Unnecessary Nested Blocks

#### Rationale
In JavaScript, prior to ES6, standalone code blocks delimited by curly braces do not create a new scope and have no use.
In ES6, code blocks may create a new scope if a block-level binding (let and const), a class declaration or a function
declaration (in strict mode) are present. A block is not considered redundant in these cases. This rule aims to
eliminate unnecessary and potentially confusing blocks at the top level of a script or within other blocks.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
{}

if (foo) {
  bar();
  {
    baz();
  }
}

function bar() {
  {
    baz();
  }
}
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
if (foo) {
  if (bar) {
    baz();
  }
}

function bar() {
  baz();
}
```


### no-loop-func (warn)
Disallow function declarations within loops

#### Rationale
Writing functions within loops tends to result in errors due to the way the function creates a closure around the loop.
This warning is raised to highlight a piece of code that may not work as expected and to indicate a potential
misunderstanding of how the language works. Code may run without any problems, but may also behave unexpectedly.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
for (var i=10; i; i--) {
  (function() { return i; })();
}

while(i) {
  var a = function() { return i; };
  a();
}
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
var a = function() {};

for (var i=10; i; i--) {
    a();
}
```


### no-multi-spaces (error) 🛠
Disallow multiple spaces

#### Rationale
Multiple spaces in a row that are not used for indentation are typically mistakes. Inconsistent spacing can lead to
code which is difficult to read. This rule aims to disallow multiple whitespace around logical expressions, conditional
expressions, declarations, array elements, object properties, sequences and function parameters. This rule can be
used to automatically correct spacing with the `fix` option.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
var a =  1;

if(foo   === 'bar') {}

a <<  b

var arr = [1,  2];

a ?  b: c
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
var a = 1;

if(foo === 'bar') {}

a << b

var arr = [1, 2];

a ? b: c
```


### no-multi-str (error)
Disallow Multiline Strings

#### Rationale
It is considered bad practice to use multiline strings because it was originally an undocumented feature of JavaScript.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
var x = 'Line 1 \
         Line 2';
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
var x = 'Line 1\n' +
        'Line 2';
```


### no-new-func (warn)
Disallow Function Constructor

#### Rationale
It’s possible to create functions in JavaScript using the Function constructor; however, this is considered by many to
be a bad practice due to the difficulty in debugging and reading these types of functions. By passing a string to the
Function constructor, you are requiring the engine to parse that string much in the way it has to when you call the
`eval` function, also a bad practice.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
var x = new Function('a', 'b', 'return a + b');
var x = Function('a', 'b', 'return a + b');
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
var x = function (a, b) {
    return a + b;
};
```


### no-octal (error) [recommended]
Disallow Octal literals

#### Rationale
Octal literals are numerals that begin with a leading zero (e.g `071`). Because the leading zero which identifies an
octal literal has been a source of confusion and error in JavaScript code, they were deprecated in ES5.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
var num = 071;
var result = 5 + 07;
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
var num  = '071';
```


### no-octal-escape (error)
Disallow octal escape sequences in string literals

#### Rationale
As of the ES5 specification, octal escape sequences in string literals are deprecated and should not be used.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
var foo = 'Copyright \251';
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
var foo = 'Copyright \u00A9';   // unicode
```


### no-proto (error)
Disallow Use of `__proto__`

#### Rationale
The `__proto__` property has been deprecated as of ES3.1 and shouldn’t be used in the code.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
var a = obj.__proto__;
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
var a = Object.getPrototypeOf(obj);
```


### no-redeclare (error) [recommended]
Disallow Variable Redeclatarion

#### Rationale
In JavaScript, it’s possible to redeclare the same variable name using var. This can lead to confusion as to where the
variable is actually declared and initialized. This rule is aimed at eliminating variables that have multiple
declarations in the same scope which may lead to confusing code or unexpected behavior.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
var a = 3;
var a = 10;
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
var a = 3;
a = 10;
```


### no-return-assign (warn)
Disallow Assignment in `return` Statement

#### Rationale
One of the interesting, and sometimes confusing, aspects of JavaScript is that assignment can happen at almost any point.
Because of this, an errant equals sign can end up causing assignment when the true intent was to do a comparison.
This is especially true when using a `return` statement.  The assignment operator can lead to ambiguity of the code as
to whether the assignment was intended or if comparison was intended and the assignment is a typo.  Because of this, it
is considered a best practice to not use the assignment operator within a return statement and present a warning when
code is found that does so.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
return foo = bar + 2;
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
// Assignment Intended
foo = bar + 2;
return foo;

// Comparison Intended
return (foo === (bar + 2));
```


### no-script-url (warn)
Disallow Script URLs

#### Rationale
Using `javascript:` URLs is considered by some as a form of `eval`. Code passed in `javascript:` URLs has to be parsed
and evaluated by the browser in the same way that `eval` is processed.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
  location.href = 'javascript:void(0)';
```


### no-self-assign (error) [recommended]
Disallow Self Assignment

#### Rationale
Self assignments have no effect and are probably an error due to incomplete refactoring.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
foo = foo;
```


### no-self-compare (error)
Disallow Self Compare

#### Rationale
Comparing a variable against itself is usually an error, either due to a typo or a refactoring error. Further, it is
confusing to the reader and potentially introduce runtime errors. This error is raised to highlight a potentially
confusing and potentially pointless piece of code.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
var x = 10;
if (x === x) {
  /// Do something...
}
```


### no-throw-literal (error)
Restrict what can be thrown as an exception

#### Rationale
It is considered good practice to only throw the `Error` object itself or an object using the `Error` object as base
objects for user-defined exceptions. The fundamental benefit of `Error` objects is that they automatically keep track
of where they were built and originated.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
throw 'error';

throw 0;

throw undefined;

throw null;

var err = new Error();
throw 'an ' + err;
// err is recast to a string literal

var err = new Error();
throw `${err}`
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
throw 'error';

throw 0;

throw undefined;

throw null;

var err = new Error();
throw 'an ' + err;
// err is recast to a string literal

var err = new Error();
throw `${err}`
```


### no-unmodified-loop-condition (warn)
Disallow unmodified conditions of loops

#### Rationale
Variables in a loop condition often are modified in the loop. If not, it’s possibly a mistake. This rule finds
references which are inside of loop conditions, then checks the variables of those references are modified in the loop.
This rule presents a warning when an artifact has been discovered.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
while (node) {
  doSomething(node);
}
node = other;

for (var j = 0; j < items.length; ++i) {
  doSomething(items[j]);
}

while (node !== root) {
  doSomething(node);
}
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
while (node) {
  doSomething(node);
  node = node.parent;
}

for (var j = 0; j < items.length; ++j) {
  doSomething(items[j]);
}

// OK, the result of this binary expression is changed in this loop.
while (node !== root) {
  doSomething(node);
  node = node.parent;
}

// OK, the result of this ternary expression is changed in this loop.
while (node ? A : B) {
  doSomething(node);
  node = node.parent;
}
```


### no-unused-expressions (warn)
Disallow Unused Expressions

#### Rationale
An unused expression which has no effect on the state of the program indicates a logic error. For example, `n + 1;` is
not a syntax error, but it might be a typing mistake where a programmer meant an assignment statement `n += 1;` instead.
This rule aims to eliminate unused expressions which have no effect on the state of the program. This rule does not
apply to function calls or constructor calls with the `new` operator, because they could have side effects on the state
of the program.

Note: One or more string expression statements (with or without semi-colons) will only be considered as unused if they
are not in the beginning of a script, module, or function (alone and uninterrupted by other statements). Otherwise, they
will be treated as part of a “directive prologue”, a section potentially usable by JavaScript engines. This includes
“strict mode” directives.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
0

if(0) 0

{0}

f(0), {}

a && b()

a, b()

c = a, b;
```


### no-useless-call (error)
Disallow unnecessary `.call()` and `.apply()`

#### Rationale
Function invocations can be written by `Function.prototype.call()` and `Function.prototype.apply()`. But
`Function.prototype.call()` and `Function.prototype.apply()` are slower than the normal function invocation. This rule
is aimed to flag usage of `Function.prototype.call()` and `Function.prototype.apply()` that can be replaced with the
normal function invocation.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
// These are same as `foo(1, 2, 3);`
foo.call(undefined, 1, 2, 3);
foo.apply(undefined, [1, 2, 3]);
foo.call(null, 1, 2, 3);
foo.apply(null, [1, 2, 3]);

// These are same as `obj.foo(1, 2, 3);`
obj.foo.call(obj, 1, 2, 3);
obj.foo.apply(obj, [1, 2, 3]);
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
foo(1, 2, 3);
obj.foo(1, 2, 3);

// The `this` binding is different.
foo.call(obj, 1, 2, 3);
foo.apply(obj, [1, 2, 3]);
obj.foo.call(null, 1, 2, 3);
obj.foo.apply(null, [1, 2, 3]);
obj.foo.call(otherObj, 1, 2, 3);
obj.foo.apply(otherObj, [1, 2, 3]);

// The argument list is variadic.
foo.apply(undefined, args);
foo.apply(null, args);
obj.foo.apply(obj, args);
```


### no-useless-escape (error) [recommended]
Disallow unnecessary escape usage.

#### Rationale
Escaping non-special characters in strings, template literals, and regular expressions doesn’t have any effect and is
incorrect language usage. This rule flags escapes that can be removed without changing behavior.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
"\'";
'\"';
"\#";
"\e";
`\"`;
`\"${foo}\"`;
`\#{foo}`;
/\!/;
/\@/;
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
"\"";
'\'';
"\x12";
"\u00a9";
"\371";
"xs\u2111";
`\``;
`\${${foo}\}`;
`$\{${foo}\}`;
/\\/g;
/\t/g;
/\w\$\*\^\./;
```


### no-void (error)
Disallow use of the void operator.

#### Rationale
The `void` operator takes an operand and returns `undefined: void expression` will evaluate `expression` and return
`undefined`. It can be used to ignore any side effects `expression` may produce.  The common case of using `void`
operator is to get a “pure” undefined value as prior to ES5 the `undefined` variable was mutable.

However, as of ES6 `undefined` is no long mutable and the `void` operator is considered obtuse and difficult to read.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
void foo

var foo = void bar();
```


### no-warning-comments (warn)
Disallow Warning Comments

#### Rationale
Developers often add comments to code which is not complete or needs review. Most likely to fix or review the code, and
then remove the comment, before the code is to be production ready. This rule is configured to provide a warning when
comments begin with the words `TODO`, `NOTE`, or `FIXME`.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
// TODO: do something
// FIXME: this is not a good idea
// NOTE: Information
```


### require-await (warn)
Disallow `async` functions which have no `await` expression

#### Rationale
`async` functions which have no `await` expression may be the unintentional result of refactoring.  This rule warns whenever
`async` functions which have no `await` expression.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
async function foo() {
  doSomething();
}

bar(async () => {
  doSomething();
});
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
async function foo() {
  await doSomething();
}

bar(async () => {
  await doSomething();
});
```


### yoda (error) 🛠
Disallows Yoda conditionals, that is conditions where a literal value is on the left-had side of the comparison like
`('red' === color)`

#### Rationale
This rule aims to enforce consistent style of conditions which compare a variable to a literal value.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
if ("red" === color) {
  // ...
}

if (true == flag) {
  // ...
}

if (5 > count) {
    // ...
}

if (-1 < str.indexOf(substr)) {
    // ...
}

if (0 <= x && x < 1) {
    // ...
}
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
if (5 & value) {
    // ...
}

if (value === "red") {
    // ...
}
```



## Variables
Rules dealing with the use of variables


### no-delete-var (warn)
Disallow deleting variables

#### Rationale
The purpose of the `delete` operator is to remove a property from an object; however, using the `delete`
operator on a variable might lead to unexpected behavior in the codebase. This is set as a warning so that
additional code review can be performed.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
var x;
delete x;
```


### no-shadow (warn)
Disallow variable declarations from shadowing variables declared in the outer scope.

#### Rationale
Shadowing is the process by which a local variable shares the same name as a variable in its containing scope. This
can cause confusion while reading the code and it’s impossible to access the global variable. This is set as a warning
to indicated that additional code review should be performed.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
var a = 3;
function b() {
  var a = 10;
}

var b = function () {
  var a = 10;
}

function b(a) {
  a = 10;
}
b(a);

if (true) {
  let a = 5;
}
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
let a = 3;
function b() {
  let inner_a = 10;
}
```


### no-shadow-restricted-names (error)
Disallow Shadowing of Restricted Names

#### Rationale
ES5 §15.1.1 Value Properties of the Global Object (`NaN`, `Infinity`, `undefined`) as well as strict mode restricted
identifiers `eval` and `arguments` are considered to be restricted names in JavaScript. Defining them to mean
something else can have unintended consequences and confuse others reading the code.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
function NaN(){}

!function(Infinity){};

var undefined;

try {} catch(eval){}
```


### no-undef (error) [recommended]
Disallow Undeclared Variables

#### Rationale
This rule is designed to help locate potential ReferenceErrors resulting from misspellings of variable and parameter
names, or accidental implicit globals (for example, from forgetting the `let` keyword in a `for` loop initializer).

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
var a = someFunction();
b = 10;
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
var a = someFunction();
var b = 10;
```


### no-undef-init (error) 🛠
Disallow Initializing to `undefined`

#### Rationale
In JavaScript, a variable that is declared and not initialized to any value automatically gets the value of
`undefined`; therefore, it is unnecessary to initialize a variable to `undefined` and considered bad practice.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
var foo = undefined;
```


### no-use-before-define (error)
Disallow early use of variables

#### Rationale
In JavaScript, prior to ES6, variable and function declarations are hoisted to the top of a scope, so it’s possible to
use identifiers before their formal declarations in code. This can be confusing and lead to code that is difficult to
maintain. Therefore, it is considered a best practice to always declare variables and functions before using them.

Further, ES6's block-level bindings (`let` and `const`) introduce a “temporal dead zone” where a `ReferenceError`
will be thrown with any attempt to access the variable before its declaration.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
alert(a);
var a = 10;

f();
function f() {}
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
var a;
a = 10;
alert(a);

function f() {}
f(1);
```


### no-unused-vars (error) [recommended]
Disallow Unused Variables

#### Rationale
Variables that are declared and not used anywhere in the code are most likely an error due to incomplete refactoring.
Such variables take up space in the code and can lead to confusion by readers. This rule is aimed at eliminating
unused variables, functions, and parameters of functions.

A variable is considered to be used if any of the following are true:

  * It represents a function that is called (`doSomething()`)
  * It is read (`var y = x`)
  * It is passed into a function as an argument (`doSomething(x)`)
  * It is read inside of a function that is passed to another function (`doSomething(function() { foo(); })`)

A variable is *not* considered to be used if it is only ever assigned to (`var x = 5`) or declared.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
// It checks variables you have defined as global
some_unused_var = 42;

var x;

// Write-only variables are not considered as used.
var y = 10;
y = 5;

// A read for a modification of itself is not considered as used.
var z = 0;
z = z + 1;

// By default, unused arguments cause warnings.
(function(foo) {
  return 5;
})();

// Unused recursive functions also cause warnings.
function fact(n) {
  if (n < 2) return 1;
  return n * fact(n - 1);
}

// When a function definition destructures an array, unused entries from the array also cause warnings.
function getY([x, y]) {
  return y;
}
```


## Node.js / CommonJS
Rules dealing with NodeJS behaviors and deprecations


### no-buffer-constructor (error)
Disallow use of the `Buffer()` constructor

#### Rationale
In Node.js, the behavior of the `Buffer` constructor is different depending on the type of its argument. Passing an
argument from user input to `Buffer()` without validating its type can lead to security vulnerabilities such as remote
memory disclosure and denial of service.  As a result the `Buffer` constructor was deprecated with ES6 and should not
be used.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
new Buffer(5);
new Buffer([1, 2, 3]);

Buffer(5);
Buffer([1, 2, 3]);

new Buffer(res.body.amount);
new Buffer(res.body.values);
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
// Buffer.alloc, Buffer.allocUnsafe, and Buffer.from should be used instead
Buffer.alloc(5);
Buffer.allocUnsafe(5);
Buffer.from([1, 2, 3]);

Buffer.alloc(res.body.amount);
Buffer.from(res.body.values);
```


### no-new-require (error)
Disallow `new` with `require`

#### Rationale
The `require` function is used to include modules that exist in separate files. Some modules return a constructor,
which can lead to confusing code if the `new` operator is used in conjunction with the `require` function.  For this
reason it is considered bad practice to use `new` with `require`.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
var appHeader = new require('app-header');
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
var AppHeader = require('app-header');
var appHeader = new AppHeader();
```


### no-path-concat (error)
Disallow string concatenation when using `__dirname` and `__filename`

#### Rationale
In Node.js, the `__dirname` and `__filename` global variables contain the directory path and the file path of the
currently executing script file, respectively.  However, there are problems when attempting to use string concatenation
with these variables.

Firstly, you can't be sure what system the script is running on. NodeJS can be run on any computer, including Windows,
which uses a different path separator. As a result is is possible to create an invalid path using string concatenation.

Secondly, NodeJS provides the `path` module which uses system-specific information to always return the correct value
and as a result avoiding invalid paths.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
var fullPath = __dirname + "/foo.js";

var fullPath = __filename + "/foo.js";
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
var fullPath = path.join(__dirname, "foo.js");

var fullPath = path.resolve(__filename, "foo.js");
```


## Formatting Rules
Rules dealing with code formatting. Most of the rules here are purely stylistic and follow the ES6 code formatting
guidelines.


### array-bracket-newline (error) 🛠
Enforce line breaks after opening and before closing array brackets

#### Rationale
The ES6 style guide only requires that newlines within arrays be used consistently. This rule is configured to check
for newlines between elements, if newlines are discovered between elements, then the array is checked for consistency;
meaning that the brackets should also appear on their own lines.  Since both formatting types are desirable depending
on the length of the array literal and its elements, the rule only checks for consistency.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
var arr = [ 1, 2,       // Line breaks are used inconsistently with the brackets
  3, 4,
  5 ];
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
// All elements have line breaks or no elements have line breaks
var arr1 = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ];
var arr2 = [
  1,
  2,
  3,
  4,
  5
];
```


### array-bracket-spacing (warn) 🛠
Disallow or enforce spaces inside of brackets

#### Rationale
The ES6 Style Guide prescribes that no spaces should be used between brackets and array elements. This applies to both
array literals and destructuring assignments in ES6.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
var arr = [ 'foo', 'bar' ];
var [ x, y ] = z;
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
var arr = ['foo', 'bar'];
var [x, y] = z;
```


### block-spacing (error) 🛠
Disallow or enforce spaces inside of single line blocks

#### Rationale
The ES6 Style Guide prescribes that spaces or newlines should always be used after opening braces and before closing
braces inside of blocks, including single-line blocks. This rule checks the space usages of braces within
single-line blocks.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
function foo() {return true;}
if (foo) { bar = 0;}
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
function foo() { return true; }
if (foo) { bar = 0; }
```


### brace-style (error) 🛠
Require Brace Style of `if-else` and `try-catch-finally` blocks

#### Rationale
While no single brace style is considered technically superior to others, it agreed on that consistent styling helps
code readability across teams. Further. the ES6 Style Guide recommends the usage of what is known as the
'one-true-brace-style' and this styling is consistent across the majority of NPM projects.   This rule also allows
single-line blocks

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
// Stroustrup Formatting
if (foo) {
  bar();
}
else {
  baz();
}

try {
  fizz();
}
catch (err) {
  buzz();
}

// Allman Formatting
if (foo)
{
  bar();
}
else
{
  baz();
}

try
{
  fizz();
}
catch (err)
{
  buzz();
}
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
// One True Brace Formatting
if (foo) {
  bar();
} else {
  baz();
}

try {
  fizz();
} catch (err) {
  buzz();
}
```


### camelcase (error)
Require Camelcase naming of variable.

#### Rationale
When it comes to naming variables, style guides generally fall into one of two camps: camelcase (`variableName`) or
snakecase (`variable_name`).  The ES6 Style Guide prescribes the use of camelcase variables and is triggered when
variables which are found that are non-conforming.  The rule looks for underscores (`_`) within the source, ignoring
any leading or trailing underscores. The rule also looks for variables in all uppercase which are not determined to be
constants. Finally, the rule also looks at assignments and not reads, because JavaScript data can be parsed from
external sources which may require access to non-camelcase variables or properties.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
// ES6 Import
import { no_camelcased } from "external-module";

var my_favorite_color = "#112C85";

function do_something() {
  // ...
}

obj.do_something = function() {
  // ...
};

var obj = {
  my_pref: 1
};
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
// ES6 Import
import { no_camelcased as camelCased } from "external-module";

var myFavoriteColor   = "#112C85";
var _myFavoriteColor  = "#112C85";  // Valid Leading Underscore
var myFavoriteColor_  = "#112C85";  // Valid Trailing Underscore
var MY_FAVORITE_COLOR = "#112C85";  // Valid Constant no reassignment beyond this point
var foo = bar.baz_boom;
var foo = { qux: bar.baz_boom };    // This is valid because it is a read and not an assignment

obj.doSomething();
doSomething();
new doSomething();

var { category_id: category } = query;  // Object Destructuring
```


### comma-spacing (error) 🛠
Enforces spacing around commas

#### Rationale
The ES6 Style Guide recommends consistent space styling around commas and that no spaces be used before commas, and a
single space be used after commas.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
var foo = 1 ,bar = 2;
var foo = 1,bar = 2;
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
var foo = 1, bar = 2;
```


### comma-style (error) 🛠
Enforces Comma Styling for comma-separated lists within array literals, object literals, and variable declarations.

#### Rationale
The ES6 Style guide recommends consistent styling of newlines within comma-separated lists. Most style guides recommend
a comma-last approach for newlines; wherein a comma precedes a newline.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
var foo = 1
  , bar = 2;

var foo = [
  "apples"
  , "oranges"
];
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
var foo = 1, bar = 2;

var foo = 1,
    bar = 2;

var foo = [
  "apples",
  "oranges"
];
```


### computed-property-spacing (error) 🛠
Disallow or enforce spaces inside of computed properties

#### Rationale
The ES6 Style guide recommends consistent styling of spaces within computed properties. Most style guides recommend
a disallowing any non-symbol related spaces.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
obj[foo ]
obj[ 'foo']
obj[foo[ bar ]]
var x = { [ b ]: a };
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
obj[foo]
obj['foo']
obj[foo[bar]]
var x = { [b]: a };
```


### consistent-this (error)
Require Consistent alias for `this`.

#### Rationale
Some libraries, such as jQuery, make it necessary to capture the current execution context in order to make it available
later. There are many common aliases used for `this`, such as `that`, `self`, or `me`. This rule checks for is
configured to check for `this` aliasing and that the alias is consistently assigned to `self`.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
var that = this;
var me = this;
var self = 42;
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
var that = 42;
var me = 42;
var self = this;
```


### eol-last (error) 🛠
Require or disallow newline at the end of files

#### Rationale
This rule is configured so that all files must end with an empty newline character so that they are consistent when
performing diffs and that diffs provide cleaner results.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
function doSomething() {
  var foo = 2
}//(eof)
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
function doSomething() {
  var foo = 2
}
//(eof)
```


### func-call-spacing (error) 🛠
Require or disallow spacing between function identifiers and their invocations

#### Rationale
The ES6 Style guide recommends consistent styling of spaces with function invocations and most style guides recommend
the absence of spaces between the function name and the parameters.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
alert ('Hello');
console.log (42);
new Date ();
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
alert('Hello');
console.log(42);
new Date();
```


### function-paren-newline (error) 🛠
Enforce consistent line breaks inside function parentheses

#### Rationale
The ES6 style guide only requires that newlines within function parameters be used consistently. This rule is configured
to check for newlines between parameters. If newlines are discovered between parameters, then the function signature is
checked for consistency; meaning that the parenthesis should also appear on their own lines.  Since both formatting
types are desirable depending on the length of the function signature and its parameters, the rule only checks for
consistency.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js

function foo(bar,
  baz
) {}

var foo = function(
  bar, baz
) {};

var foo = (
  bar,
  baz) => {};

foo(bar,
  baz);

foo(
  function() {
    return baz;
  }
);
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
function foo(bar, baz) {}

var foo = function(
  bar,
  baz
) {};

var foo = (bar, baz) => {};

foo(bar, baz, qux);

foo(
  bar,
  baz,
  qux
);

foo(function() {
  return baz;
});
```


### id-length (error)
Enforce minimum and maximum identifier lengths

#### Rationale
Very short or very long identifier lengths can lead to code which is difficult to read and maintain. To prevent this, a
minimum and maximum identifier length has been configured to the values of `2` and `40` respectively.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
var a = 1;
var x = 2;
var thisIsAnIdentifierWhichIsExcessiveInLength = 1;
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
var itr = 0;
var jre = 2;
var thisIsAnIdentifierWhichIsLongButStillOK = 1;
```


### indent (error) 🛠
Enforce consistent indentation

#### Rationale
As ES6 has evolved to include function currying, arrow functions, destructuring, and `Promise` chaining, the ES6 Style
Guideline has changed to now recommend an indentation level of 2 spaces for purposes of code compactification.  `case`
blocks are expected to be made one indention level deeper

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
if (a) {
    b=c;
    function foo(d) {
        e=f;
    }
}

switch (a) {
  case 1:
  doSomething();
  break;
}
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
if (a) {
  b=c;
  function foo(d) {
    e=f;
  }
}

switch (a) {
  case 1:
    foo();
    break;
  case 2: {
    bar();
    break;
  }
}

```


### jsx-quotes (error) 🛠
Enforce the consistent use of either double or single quotes in JSX attributes when possible.

#### Rationale
Unlike string literals in JavaScript, string literals within JSX attributes can’t contain escaped quotes. This rule
ensures that double-quotes are used consistently when it is possible to use them.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
<a b='c' />
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
<a b="c" />
<a b='"' />     // Single-quotes necessary because the literal contains a double-quote
```


### key-spacing (error) 🛠
Enforce consistent spacing between keys and values in object literal properties.

#### Rationale
The ES6 Style Guideline recommends that properties in object literals have consistent spacing around the colon. This
uses the AirBnB guidelines of no space before the colon, and at least one space after the colon.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
var obj = { "foo" : 42 };
var obj = { "foo" :42 };
var obj = { "foo":42 };
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
var obj = { "foo": 42, "bar": 100 };
var obj2 = {
  red:    1,
  yellow: 2,
  green:  3,
  blue:   4
}
```


### keyword-spacing (error) 🛠
Enforce consistent spacing before and after keywords

#### Rationale
Keywords are syntax elements of JavaScript, such as function and if. These identifiers have special meaning to the
language and so often appear in a different color in code editors. As an important part of the language, the ES6 style
guides recommends a single space both preceding and proceeding each keyword where the keyword, except preceding a
a keyword at the beginning of a statement or newline.  This applies to: `as` (in module declarations), `async` (of async
functions), `await` (of await expressions), `break`, `case`, `catch`, `class`, `const`, `continue`, `debugger`,
`default`, `delete`, `do`, `else`, `export`, `extends`, `finally`, `for`, `from` (in module declarations), `function`,
`get` (of getters), `if`, `import`, `in`, `instanceof`, `let`, `new`, `of` (in for-of statements), `return`, `set` (of
setters), `static`, `super`, `switch`, `this`, `throw`, `try`, `typeof`, `var`, `void`, `while`, `with`, and `yield`.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
if(foo) {
    //...
}else if(bar) {
    //...
} else{
    //...
}
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
if (foo) {
    //...
} else if (bar) {
    //...
} else {
    //...
}
```


### linebreak-style (error) 🛠
Enforce consistent linebreak styles

#### Rationale
Differing linebreak styles can become problematic for performing diffs of code that were edited on different operating
systems. This rule enforces consistent line endings independent of the operating system, VCS, or editor used across your
codebase.  The rule is configured to ensure that `unix` line endings (`\n`) are used.


### lines-around-comment (error) 🛠
Require empty lines around comments

#### Rationale
The ES6 Style Guide recommends that newlines are placed before block comments (`/* */`) to increase readability and
block separation.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
var itr = 1;
/*
 * Block Comments
 */
var jtr = 2;
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
var itr = 1;

/*
 * Block Comments
 */
 var jtr = 2;
```


### lines-between-class-members (error) 🛠
Require or disallow an empty line between class members

#### Rationale
This rule improves readability by enforcing lines between class members. It will not check empty lines before the first
member and after the last member, since that is already taken care of by padded-blocks.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
class MyClass {
  foo() {
    //...
  }
  bar() {
    //...
  }
}
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
class MyClass {
  foo() {
    //...
  }

  // Line Break above spaces members
  bar() {
    //...
  }
}
```


### max-len (warn)
Enforce a maximum line length

#### Rationale
Very long lines of code in any language can be difficult to read. In order to aid in readability and maintainability
a warning is generated for lines exceeding 120 characters.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
var foo = { "bar": "This is a bar.", "baz": { "qux": "This is a qux" }, "difficult": "to read since this line is very long in length" }; // very long
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
var foo = {
  bar: "This is a bar.",
  baz: {
    qux: "This is a qux"
  },
  difficult: "to read since this line is very long in length"
};
```


### new-cap (error)
Require constructor names to begin with a capital letter

#### Rationale
The `new` operator in JavaScript creates a new instance of a particular type of object. That type of object is
represented by a constructor function. Since constructor functions are just regular functions, the only defining
characteristic is that `new` is being used as part of the call. Native JavaScript functions begin with an uppercase
letter to distinguish those functions that are to be used as constructors from functions that are not. The ES6 style
guide recommends following this pattern to more easily determine which functions are to be used as constructors.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
var friend = new person();
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
var friend = new Person();
```


### new-parens (error) 🛠
Require parentheses when invoking a constructor with no arguments

#### Rationale
JavaScript allows the omission of parentheses when invoking a function via the `new` keyword and the constructor has no
arguments.  However, this syntax can lead to unintentionally obtuse code which is difficult to read or maintain. The
ES6 Style Guide recommends that all constructors, including those with no arguments, be used with a set of parentheses.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
var person = new Person;
var person = new (Person);
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
var person = new Person();
```


### newline-per-chained-call (error)
Require a newline after each call in a method chain

#### Rationale
Chained method calls on a single line without line breaks are valid but are more difficult to read and maintain due to
how diffs are calculated. The ES6 Style Guide recommends that each chained method be placed on its own line for the
purpose of code clarity. This rule ignores chains of depth 2 or less.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
d3.select("body").selectAll("p").data([4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 ]).enter();
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
d3
  .select("body")
  .selectAll("p")
  .data([4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 ])
  .enter();

// Chain Depth of 2
d3.select("body").selectAll("p")
```


### no-array-constructor (error)
Disallow creation of dense arrays using the Array constructor

#### Rationale
Use of the `Array` constructor to construct a new array is generally discouraged in favor of array literal notation
because of the single-argument pitfall and because the `Array` global may be redefined. The exception is when the Array
constructor is used to intentionally create sparse arrays of a specified size by giving the constructor a single
numeric argument.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
Array(0, 1, 2)      // error The array literal notation [] is preferable.
new Array(0, 1, 2)  // error The array literal notation [] is preferable.
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
var arr = [0, 1, 2];
var arr2 = Array(500);                        // Sparse Array of length 500
var arr3 = new Array(someOtherArray.length)   // Sparse Array of programatic length
```


### no-lonely-if (error) 🛠
Disallow `if` statements as the only statement within an `else` block.

#### Rationale
If an `if` statement is the only statement in the `else` block, it is often clearer to use an `else if` form.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
if (foo) {
  // ...
} else {
  if (bar) {
    // ...
  }
}
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
if (foo) {
  // ...
} else if (bar) {
  // ...
}
```


### no-mixed-spaces-and-tabs (error) [recommended]
Disallow mixed spaces and tabs for indentation

#### Rationale
Tabs and spaces should not be used interchangeably for indentation as such code leads to illegible code and causes
problems for calculating diffs.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
function add(x, y) {
// --->..return x + y;
      return x + y;
}
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
// ......return x + y;
      return x + y;
```


### no-multi-assign (error)
Disallow Use of Chained Assignment Expressions

#### Rationale
Chaining the assignment of variables can lead to unexpected results and be difficult to read.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
var a = b = c = 5;
var foo = bar = "baz";
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
var a = 5;
var b = 5;
var c = 5;

var foo = "baz";
var bar = "baz";
```


### no-multiple-empty-lines (error) 🛠
Disallow multiple consecutive empty lines

#### Rationale
This rule aims to reduce the scrolling required when reading through your code. It will warn when the maximum amount of
empty lines has been exceeded.  This rule is configured for a max of 2 consecutive empty lines in the body of the code.
It is also configured to enforce no more than 1 empty line at the begining and end of a file.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
var foo = 5;



var bar = 3;
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
var foo = 5;


var bar = 3;
```


### no-new-object (error)
Disallow Object Constructors

#### Rationale
The `Object` constructor is used to create new generic objects in JavaScript, but is no different from using the more
concise object literal syntax. The ES6 Style Guide recommends avoiding the `Object` constructor because it leads to
less concise code.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
var myObject = new Object();

var myObject = new Object;
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
var myObject = {};
```


### no-tabs (error)
Disallow all Tabs

#### Rationale
For consistency of code, the ES6 style guide recommends that spaces and tabs not be mixed. This rule looks for any tabs
within the source file and reports an error.  This rule does not check the tab character (`\t`) within a string literal.


### no-unneeded-ternary (error) 🛠
Disallow ternary (`?:`) operators when simpler alternatives exist

#### Rationale
It’s a common mistake in JavaScript to use a conditional expression to select between two Boolean values instead of
using `!` to convert the test to a Boolean. Another common mistake is using a single variable as both the conditional
test and the consequent. In such cases, the logical OR can be used to provide the same functionality.  This rule reports
an error when a simpler solution exists than the ternary operators which are used.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
var isYes = (answer === 1) ? true : false;
var isNo = (answer === 1) ? false : true;
var foo = bar ? bar : 1;
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
var isYes = (answer === 1);
var isNo = (answer !== 1);
var foo = bar || 1;
```


### no-whitespace-before-property (error) 🛠
Disallow whitespace before properties

#### Rationale
JavaScript allows whitespace between objects and their properties. However, inconsistent spacing can make code harder to
read and can lead to errors.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
foo [bar]

foo. bar

foo .bar

foo. bar. baz

foo. bar()
  .baz()

foo
  .bar(). baz()
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
foo.bar

foo[bar]

foo[ bar ]

foo.bar.baz

foo
  .bar().baz()

foo
  .bar()
  .baz()

foo.
  bar().
  baz()
```


### object-curly-newline (error) 🛠
Enforce consistent line breaks inside braces of object literals

#### Rationale
Similar to the rule for arrays and function signatures, this rule ensures that the ES6 recommendations for code
consistency are enforced. In this case, dealing with the newlines after braces when elements also have new lines.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
let a = {
};
let b = {
  foo: 1
};
let c = {
  foo: 1, bar: 2
};
let d = {foo: 1,
  bar: 2};
let e = {foo: function() {
  doSomething();
}};
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
let a = { };
let b = { foo: 1 };
let c = { foo: 1, bar: 2 };
let d = {
  foo: 1,
  bar: 2
};
let e = {
  foo: function() {
    doSomething();
  }
};
```


### object-curly-spacing (error) 🛠
Enforce consistent spacing inside braces

#### Rationale
The ES6 Style Guide recommends the consistent use of spacing within object literals, destructuring assignments, and
import/export specifiers. The AirBnB guidelines recommend spacing within braces to improve readability.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
var obj = {'foo': 'bar'};
var obj = {'foo': 'bar' };
var obj = { baz: {'foo': 'qux'}, bar};
var obj = {baz: { 'foo': 'qux' }, bar};
var obj = {'foo': 'bar'
};
var obj = {
  'foo':'bar'};
var {x} = y;
import {foo } from 'bar';
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
var obj = {};
var obj = { 'foo': 'bar' };
var obj = { 'foo': { 'bar': 'baz' }, 'qux': 'quxx' };
var obj = {
  'foo': 'bar'
};
var { x } = y;
import { foo } from 'bar';
```


### operator-assignment (warn) 🛠
Require or disallow assignment operator shorthand where possible

#### Rationale
The ES6 Style Guide recommends for the consistent use of shorthand operators (e.g. `x += y`) if they are used. This
rule provide a warning for additional code review when a shorthand operator could be used but was not.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
x = x + y;
y = y + 1;
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
x += y;
y += 1;
y++; // Alternative;y
```


### operator-linebreak (error) 🛠
Enforce consistent linebreak style for operators

#### Rationale
The ES6 Style guide recommends for the consistent usage of line breaks and operators when lines are too long to fit on
a single line. The AirBnB guidelines suggest that line breaks occur after operators, ternary operators are ignored.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
var fullHeight = borderTop
               + innerHeight +
               offset + inset
               + borderBottom;
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
var fullHeight = borderTop +
                innerHeight +
                offset +
                inset +
                borderBottom;
```


### quote-props (error) 🛠
Require quotes around object literal property names

#### Rationale
Object literal property names can be defined in two ways: using literals or using strings. The ES6 Style Guide
recommends that the coding style chosen is consistent throughout code, except where it is unavoidable.  This rule is
configured to only require properties be quoted when it is necessary.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
var object = {
  "a": 0,
  "0": 0,
  "true": 0,
  "null": 0
};
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
var object1 = {
  "a-b": 0,
  "0x0": 0,
  "1e2": 0
};

var object2 = {
  foo: 'bar',
  baz: 42,
  true: 0,
  0: 0,
  'qux-lorem': true
};

var object3 = {
  foo() {
    return;
  }
};
```


### quotes (error) 🛠
Enforce the consistent use of either backticks, double, or single quotes

#### Rationale
The ES6 Style Guide recommends consistent use of quotes throughout code, except where an alternative is unavoidable. For
example, when using template literals. The AirBnB guide prescribes the use of of single-quotes by used for strings
throughout a codebase.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
var double = "double";
var unescaped = "a string containing 'single' quotes";
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
var single = 'single';
var backtick = `back${x}tick`; // backticks are allowed due to template literal substitution
```


### semi (error) 🛠
Require or disallow semicolons instead of ASI

#### Rationale
JavaScript is unique amongst the C-like languages in that it doesn’t require semicolons at the end of each statement.
In many cases, the JavaScript engine can determine that a semicolon should be in a certain spot and will automatically
add it. This feature is known as automatic semicolon insertion (ASI) and is considered one of the more controversial
features of JavaScript.  However, the rules for when ASI is invoked can be confusing and in some cases lead to
unexpected behavior in code, syntax errors, and difficulty in code readability and maintenance; therefore, most styles
guides enforce the use of semicolons so that the intention of the code author is clear to later maintainers.

#### ASI example
ASI will interpret the following code:
```js
return
{
  name: "ESLint"
};
```
As:
```js
return;
{
  name: "ESLint"
}
```

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
var name = "ESLint"

object.method = function() {
  // ...
}
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
var name = "ESLint";

object.method = function() {
  // ...
};
```


### semi-spacing (error) 🛠
Enforce spacing before and after semicolons

#### Rationale
The ES6 Style Guide recommends consistent use of spacing around semicolons throughout code. The AirBnB guide prescribes
that a space be placed after a semicolon and no space be placed before, where semicolons appear on the same lines as
other code, such as within a `for` loop.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
for (let itr=0;itr < 10 ;itr++) {
  // Do something
}
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
for (let itr=0; itr < 10; itr++) {
  // Do something
}
```


### semi-style (error) 🛠
Enforce location of semicolons

#### Rationale
The ES6 Style Guide recommends consistent semicolon positioning throughout code. The AirBnB guide prescribes that
semicolons are placed at the end of lines for statement termination;

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
foo()
;[1, 2, 3].forEach(bar)

for (
  var i = 0
  ; i < 10
  ; ++i
) {
  foo()
}
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
foo();
[1, 2, 3].forEach(bar);

for (var i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
  foo();
}
```


### space-before-blocks (error) 🛠
Require Or Disallow Space Before Blocks

#### Rationale
The ES6 Style Guide recommends consistent use of space before blocks. The AirBnB guide prescribes that there should be
one space preceding a code block.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
if (a){
  b();
}

function a(){}

for (;;){
  b();
}

try {} catch(a){}

class Foo{
  constructor(){}
}
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
if (a) {
  b();
}

if (a) {
  b();
} else {
  c();
}


function a() { }

for (;;) {
  b();
}

try { } catch(a) { }
```


### space-before-function-paren (error) 🛠
Require or disallow a space before function parenthesis

#### Rationale
The ES6 Style Guide recommends consistent use of space before function calls and signatures. The AirBnB guide prescribes
that there should be no space in this location.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
function foo () {
  // ...
}

var bar = function () {
  // ...
};

var bar = function foo () {
  // ...
};

class Foo {
  constructor () {
    // ...
  }
}

var foo = {
  bar () {
    // ...
  }
};

var foo = async () => 1
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
function foo() {
  // ...
}

var bar = function() {
  // ...
};

var bar = function foo() {
  // ...
};

class Foo {
  constructor() {
    // ...
  }
}

var foo = {
  bar() {
    // ...
  }
};

var foo = async() => 1
```


### space-in-parens (error) 🛠
Disallow or enforce spaces inside of parentheses

#### Rationale
The ES6 Style Guide recommends consistent use of space within parenthesis. The AirBnB guide prescribes that there should
be no space adjacent to the insides of parenthesis.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
foo( );
foo( 'bar');
foo('bar' );
foo( 'bar' );

var foo = ( 1 + 2 ) * 3;
( function () { return 'bar'; }() );
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
foo();

foo('bar');

var foo = (1 + 2) * 3;
(function () { return 'bar'; }());
```


### space-infix-ops (error) 🛠
Require spacing around infix (`=`, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `^`, `&`, `|`) operators

#### Rationale
The ES6 Style Guide recommends consistent use of spaces around infix operators. The AirBnB guide prescribes that spaces
should surround any infix operator.  This is important because it can avoid problems where the author's intention
within the code is not clear (e.g. `sum = i+++2` -- did the author mean `i++ + 2` or `i + 2` with a typo?)

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
a+b

a+ b

a +b

a?b:c

const a={b:1};

var {a=0}=bar;

function foo(a=0) { }
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
a + b

a       + b

a ? b : c

const a = {b:1};

var {a = 0} = bar;

function foo(a = 0) { }
```


### space-unary-ops (error) 🛠
Require or disallow spaces before/after unary operators.

#### Rationale
Javascript provides two types of unary operators: words (`new`, `delete`, `typeof`, `void`, and `yield`), and symbols
(`-`, `+`, `--`, `++`, `~`, `!`, `~~`, `!!`) operators. The ES6 Style Guide recommends consistent use of spaces around
each type of unary operator. The AirBnB guide prescribes that spaces should surround any word-based unary operator
and no spaces should be used around symbol-based unary operators.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
typeof!foo;

void{foo:0};

new[foo][0];

delete(foo.bar);

++ foo;

foo --;

- foo;

+ "3";

function *foo() {
  yield(0)
}
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
// Word unary operator "delete" is followed by a whitespace.
delete foo.bar;

// Word unary operator "new" is followed by a whitespace.
new Foo;

// Word unary operator "void" is followed by a whitespace.
void 0;

// Unary operator "++" is not followed by whitespace.
++foo;

// Unary operator "--" is not preceded by whitespace.
foo--;

// Unary operator "-" is not followed by whitespace.
-foo;

// Unary operator "+" is not followed by whitespace.
+"3";

function *foo() {
  yield (0)
}
```


### spaced-comment (warn) 🛠
Requires or disallows a whitespace (space) beginning a comment

#### Rationale
Whitespace after the `//` or `/*` makes it easier to read text in comments and many code editors will automatically
place a space after a comment created with built-in code comment macros (`CMD`+`/` / `CTL`+`/`). Additionally,
consistent comment formatting makes code easier to read.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
//Bad Comment
/*Bad Block */
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
// Good Comment
/* Good Block */
```


### switch-colon-spacing (error) 🛠
Enforce spacing around colons of switch statements

#### Rationale
Spacing around colons improves readability of `case`/`default` clauses. The ES6 Style Guide recommends consistent use of
spaces around colons within `case` and `default` statements. The AirBnB guide prescribes that spaces should be used
after a colon in a case and no space should be used before the case.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
switch (a) {
  case 0 :break;
  default :foo();
}
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
switch (a) {
  case 0: foo(); break;
  case 1:
    bar();
    break;
  default:
    baz();
    break;
}
```


### template-tag-spacing (error) 🛠
Require or disallow spacing between template tags and their literals

#### Rationale
With ES6, it’s possible to create functions called tagged template literals where the function parameters consist of a
template literal’s strings and expressions. The ES6 Style Guide recommends consistent code styling and the AirBnB style
guide recommends that no spaces are used between a tag function and its template literal.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
function func(str) {
  return str[0];
}

func `Hello world`;
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
function func(str) {
  return str[0];
}

func`Hello world`;
```


## ES6 Rules
Rules dealing with ES6 code formatting and behaviors


### arrow-body-style (error) 🛠
Require braces in arrow function body

#### Rationale
The ES6 Style Guide recommends consistent use of spacing and function bodies of arrow functions should be used
consistently. The AirBnB guide prescribes that body style arrow functions are preferred.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
let foo = () => 0
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
let foo = (() => {
    return 0;
});

let foo = ((retv, name) => {
    retv[name] = true;
    return retv;
});
```


### arrow-parens (error) 🛠
Require parens in arror function arguments

#### Rationale
In ES6, arrow functions can omit parentheses when they have exactly one parameter (arity of 1). However, this leads to
code with inconsistent syntax and may cause problems understanding the author's intent, for example when `=>` is a typo
for `>=`. Therefore, it is recommended that parens are used for arrow function parameters regardless of arity.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
a => {};
a => a;
a => {'\n'};
a.then(foo => {});
a.then(foo => a);
a(foo => { if (true) {} });
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
() => {};
(a) => {};
(a) => a;
(a) => {'\n'}
a.then((foo) => {});
a.then((foo) => { if (true) {} });
```


### arrow-spacing (error) 🛠
Require space before/after arrow function’s arrow

#### Rationale
The ES6 Style Guide recommends that usage of spacing around the arrow function `=>` be consistent. The AirBnB guide
prescribes the use of spaces both before and after the arrow.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
(a)=>{}
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
(a) => { }
```


### constructor-super (error) [recommended]
Verify calls of `super()` in constructors

#### Rationale
To prevent `ReferenceErrors` and other syntax problems, it is a best practice to ensure that `super()` is always
called from the constructor of a derived class.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
class A {
  constructor() {
    super();  // This is a SyntaxError.
  }
}

class A extends B {
  constructor() { }  // Would throw a ReferenceError.
}

// Classes which inherits from a non constructor are always problems.
class A extends null {
  constructor() {
    super();  // Would throw a TypeError.
  }
}

class A extends null {
  constructor() { }  // Would throw a ReferenceError.
}
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
class A {
  constructor() { }
}

class A extends B {
  constructor() {
    super();
  }
}
```


### generator-star-spacing (error) 🛠
Enforce spacing around the * in generator functions

#### Rationale
Generators are a new type of function in ES6 that can return multiple values over time. These special functions
are indicated by placing an star(`*`) after the `function` keyword. The ES6 Style Guide recommends that usage of spacing
around the `*` be consistent. The AirBnB guide prescribes the use of a spaces before and no space after the star.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
function * generator() {
    yield "44";
    yield "55";
}
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
function *generator() {
    yield "44";
    yield "55";
}
```


### no-class-assign (error)  
Disallow modifying variables of class declarations

#### Rationale
Because a `ClassDeclaration` creates a variable, it is possible to modify it. However, modifying is a mistake in most
cases and can lead to unexpected behavior and difficult to maintain code. This rule prohibits the reassigning of a
previously defined class.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
class A { }
A = 0;

class A {
    b() {
        A = 0;
    }
}
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
let A = class A { }
A = 0; // A is a variable.

let A = class {
    b() {
        A = 0; // A is a variable.
    }
}
```


### no-confusing-arrow (error) 🛠
Disallow arrow functions where they could be confused with comparisons

#### Rationale
Arrow functions (`=>`) are similar in syntax to some comparison operators (`>`, `<`, `<=`, and `>=`). This rule warns
against using the arrow function syntax in places where it could be confused with a comparison operator. Even if the
arguments of the arrow function are wrapped with parens.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
// The intent is not clear
var x = a => 1 ? 2 : 3;
var x = (a) => 1 ? 2 : 3;
var x = (a) => (1 ? 2 : 3);
// Did the author mean this
// var x = function (a) { return 1 ? 2 : 3 };
// Or this
// var x = a <= 1 ? 2 : 3;
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
var x = (a) => { return 1 ? 2 : 3; };
```


### no-const-assign (error) [recommended]
Disallow modifying variables that are declared using `const`

#### Rationale
Variables that are declared using `const` keyword can not be modified later and will raise a runtime error. This rule
alerts when bad code exists.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
const a = 0;
a = 1;    // Bad
a += 1;   // Bad
++a;      // Bad
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
const a = 0;
console.log(a);

for (const a in [1, 2, 3]) { // `a` is re-defined (not modified) on each loop step.
    console.log(a);
}
```


### no-dupe-class-members (error) [recommended]
Disallow duplicate name in class members

#### Rationale
If there are declarations of the same name in class members, the last declaration overwrites other declarations
silently and can cause unexpected behaviors.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
class Foo {
  bar() { }
  bar() { }
}

class Foo {
  bar() { }
  get bar() { }
}

class Foo {
  static bar() { }
  static bar() { }
}
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
class Foo {
  bar() { }
  qux() { }
}

class Foo {
  get bar() { }
  set bar(value) { }
}

class Foo {
  static bar() { }
  bar() { }
}
```


### no-new-symbol (error) [recommended]
Disallow Symbol Constructor

#### Rationale
`Symbol` is not intended to be used with the `new` operator, but to be called as a function. A `TypeError` is thrown
when attempted at runtime.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
var foo = new Symbol('foo');
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
var foo = Symbol('foo');


// Ignores shadowed Symbol.
function bar(Symbol) {
    const baz = new Symbol("baz");
}
```


### no-this-before-super (error) [recommended]
Disallow use of `this`/`super` before calling `super()` in constructors

#### Rationale
In the constructor of derived classes, if `this`/`super` are used before `super()` calls, then it raises a reference
error. This rule checks `this`/`super` keywords in constructors, then reports those that are before `super()`.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
class A extends B {
  constructor() {
    this.a = 0;
    super();
  }
}

class A extends B {
  constructor() {
    this.foo();
    super();
  }
}

class A extends B {
  constructor() {
    super.foo();
    super();
  }
}

class A extends B {
  constructor() {
    super(this.foo());
  }
}
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
class A {
  constructor() {
    this.a = 0; // OK, this class doesn't have an `extends` clause.
  }
}

class A extends B {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.a = 0; // OK, this is after `super()`.
  }
}

class A extends B {
  foo() {
    this.a = 0; // OK. this is not in a constructor.
  }
}
```


### no-var (warn) 🛠
Require `let` and `const` instead of `var`

#### Rationale
ES6 allows programmers to create variables with block scope instead of function scope using the `let` and `const`
keywords. Block scope is common in many other programming languages and helps programmers avoid mistakes with variable
hoisting. This rule presents a warning for additional code review.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
var x = "y";
var CONFIG = {};
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
let x = "y";
const CONFIG = {};
```


### object-shorthand (error) 🛠
Require Object Literal Shorthand Syntax

#### Rationale
ES6 provides a concise form for defining object literal methods and properties. This syntax can make defining complex
object literals much cleaner. However, the ES6 style guide recommends that the shorthand syntax be used consistently
if it is used at all.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
var foo = {
    a,
    b: "foo",
};
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
var foo = {
    a: a,
    b: "foo"
};

var bar = {
    a,
    b,
};
```


### prefer-arrow-callback (error) 🛠
Suggest using arrow functions as callbacks

#### Rationale
Arrow functions are suited to callbacks, because the `this` keywords in an arrow function binds to the upper scope and
the notation of the arrow function is shorter than a function expression’s. This leads to more consistent looking code.


#### 👎 Bad code
```js
foo(function(a) { return a; });
foo(function() { return this.a; }.bind(this));
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
foo((a) => { return a; });
foo(function *() { yield; });

// this is not a callback.
var foo = function foo(a) { return a; };

// using `this` without `.bind(this)`.
foo(function() { return this.a; });

// recursively.
foo(function bar(n) { return n && n + bar(n - 1); });
```


### prefer-const (warn) 🛠
Suggest using `const`

#### Rationale
If a variable is never reassigned, using the `const` declaration is better. his rule is aimed at flagging variables that
are declared using `let` keyword, but never reassigned after the initial assignment.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
// it's initialized and never reassigned.
let a = 3;
console.log(a);
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
// it's initialized and never reassigned.
const a = 3;
console.log(a);
```


### prefer-numeric-literals (warn) 🛠
Disallow `parseInt()` in favor of binary, octal, and hexadecimal literals

#### Rationale
The `parseInt()` function can be used to turn binary, octal, and hexadecimal strings into integers. As binary, octal,
and hexadecimal literals are supported in ES6, this rule encourages use of those numeric literals instead of
`parseInt()`.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
parseInt("111110111", 2) === 503;
parseInt("767", 8) === 503;
parseInt("1F7", 16) === 255;
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
0b111110111 === 503;
0o767 === 503;
0x1F7 === 503;

a[parseInt](1,2);

parseInt(foo);
parseInt(foo, 2);
```


### prefer-rest-params (warn)  
Suggest using the rest parameters instead of `arguments`

#### Rationale
Since there are rest parameters in ES6, we can use that feature for variadic functions instead of the `arguments`
variable. Further, the `arguments` does not have methods of `Array.prototype`, so its use is no longer a best practice.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
function foo() {
  console.log(arguments);
}

function foo(action) {
  var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1);
  action.apply(null, args);
}

function foo(action) {
  var args = [].slice.call(arguments, 1);
  action.apply(null, args);
}
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
function foo(...args) {
  console.log(args);
}

function foo(action, ...args) {
  action.apply(null, args); // or `action(...args)`, related to the `prefer-spread` rule.
}

// Note: the implicit arguments can be overwritten.
function foo(arguments) {
  console.log(arguments); // This is the first argument.
}
function foo() {
  var arguments = 0;
  console.log(arguments); // This is a local variable.
}
```


### prefer-spread (warn) 🛠
Suggest using the spread operator instead of `.apply()`

#### Rationale
Before ES6, the `Function.prototype.apply()` call was needed to call variadic functions. However, in ES6 the spread
operator is now available.  This rule enforces the use of newer syntax for consistency

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
var args = [1, 2, 3, 4];
Math.max.apply(Math, args);
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
var args = [1, 2, 3, 4];
Math.max(...args);
```


### prefer-template (warn) 🛠
Suggest using template literals instead of string concatenation

#### Rationale
ES6 introduces template literals which can be used instead of string concatenation for more code with improved
readability. This rule presents an error when traditional concatenation has been done for code review.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
var str = "Hello, " + name + "!";
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
var str = `Hello, ${name}!`;
```


### require-yield (error) [recommended]
Disallow generator functions that do not have `yield`

#### Rationale
This rule generates warnings for generator functions that do not have the `yield` keyword, since the lack of the `yield`
keyword does not follow ES6 best practices.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
function* foo() {
  return 10;
}
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
function *foo() {
  yield 5;
  return 10;
}

function foo() {
  return 10;
}
```


### rest-spread-spacing (error) 🛠
Enforce spacing between rest and spread operators and their expressions

#### Rationale
ES6 introduced the rest and spread operators, which expand an iterable structure into its individual parts. However,
ES7 introduced the ability to use the rest and spread operators as a catch all in object destructuring.  This rule
enforces the preceding whitespace to the spread operator as outlined in the AirBnB style guide.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
fn(... args)
[... arr, 4, 5, 6]
let [a, b, ... arr] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
function fn(... args) { console.log(args); }
let { x, y, ... z } = { x: 1, y: 2, a: 3, b: 4 };
let n = { x, y, ... z };
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
fn(...args)
[...arr, 4, 5, 6]
let [a, b, ...arr] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
function fn(...args) { console.log(args); }
let { x, y, ...z } = { x: 1, y: 2, a: 3, b: 4 };
let n = { x, y, ...z };
```


### symbol-description (error)  
Require symbol description

#### Rationale
`Symbol` is a new base class in ES6 and may have optional descriptions. This rule promotes cleaner use of `Symbol` so
that when one is logged the description is output.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
var foo = Symbol();
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
var foo = Symbol("some description");

var someString = "some description";
var bar = Symbol(someString);
```


### template-curly-spacing (error) 🛠
Enforce Usage of Spacing in Template Strings

#### Rationale
The ES6 Style Guide recommends consistent use of spacing around expression indicators (`${`, `}`) within template
literals. The AirBnB guide prescribes that no spaces should be used immediately inside the expression indicators.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
`hello, ${ people.name}!`;
`hello, ${people.name }!`;

`hello, ${ people.name }!`;
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
`hello, ${people.name}!`;

`hello, ${
    people.name
}!`;
```


### yield-star-spacing (error) 🛠
Enforce spacing around the `*` in `yield*` expressions

#### Rationale
The ES6 Style Guide recommends consistent use of spacing around the `*` in `yield*` expressions within Generators. The
The AirBnB guide prescribes that a space should precede and no space should proceed the `*` in `yield*` expressions.

#### 👎 Bad code
```js
function* generator() {
  yield* other();
}

function * generator() {
  yield * other();
}

function*generator() {
  yield*other();
}
```

#### 👍 Good code
```js
function *generator() {
  yield *other();
}
```
